Release history for gitodo

v16.09  2016-09-03
  [Changed]
  - Use "git rev-parse HEAD" to determine if GITODO_DATA is a git
    repository instead of simply appending ".git" to the path. This
    allows GITODO_DATA to be a subdirectory of a git repo -- which means
    that you can use one single repo and have multiple "categories" of
    items, organized in subdirectories.

v15.09 and earlier releases
  - Sorry, the CHANGES file did not exist back then. Please refer to the
    Git log.
