Release history for gitodo

v17.09  2017-09-16
  [LICENSING]
  - The project has been relicensed under the MIT license (more
    precisely called "Expat License", but everyone calls it "MIT
    license" these days).

v17.04  2017-04-17
  [Fixed]
  - We now use Time.parse() to parse the "when" field and any input to
    highcal. Unlike DateTime.parse(), which we used before, it returns
    the proper time zone. (Plus, we don't need a weird hackaround for
    time zones anymore.)

v16.09  2016-09-03
  [Changed]
  - Use "git rev-parse HEAD" to determine if GITODO_DATA is a git
    repository instead of simply appending ".git" to the path. This
    allows GITODO_DATA to be a subdirectory of a git repo -- which means
    that you can use one single repo and have multiple "categories" of
    items, organized in subdirectories.

v15.09 and earlier releases
  - Sorry, the CHANGES file did not exist back then. Please refer to the
    Git log.
